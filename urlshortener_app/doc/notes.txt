It's not clear if the match must be on the WHOLE word or in part of it.
In the example provided it's stated 'lawsuit' is a good match so it looks like the first assumption is true.
Anyway i replace the code snippet to handle the second case.

    while words.count() != 0 and not found_word:
        #check if any of the token contains the first word by each char
        current_word = words[index].word_text
        index = 0
        token_found = True
        while token_found and index < len(current_word):
            token_found = False
            for token in url_tokens:
                if current_word[:index + 1] in token:
                    token_found = True
            if token_found:
                index += 1
        if index == len(current_word) and current_word.url == None:
            #current_word is ok
            found_word = True
            result = current_word
        else:
            #update the words exluding all words containg w
            words = words.exclude(word_text__contains = current_word[:index + 1])
